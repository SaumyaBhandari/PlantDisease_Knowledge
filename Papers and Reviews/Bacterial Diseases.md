Types: 

1.  [[Bacterial Canker (Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis)]]
2.  [[Bacterial Speck (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato)]] 
3.  Bacterial spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria)
4.  Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum)
5.  Southern bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2)
6.  Pith necrosis (Pseudomonas corrugata)
7.  Tomato bacterial fruit rot (Ralstonia solanacearum)




3.  Bacterial spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria):
		Causes:
			-   Caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria
			-   Enters the plant through natural openings, such as stomata or hydathodes, and through wounds
			-   Spreads through wind-driven rain, irrigation water, and contaminated tools and equipment
			-   Can survive in infected plant debris and in the soil for several years
		Symptomps:
			-   Dark, water-soaked lesions on the leaves, stems, and fruit
			-   Lesions surrounded by a yellow halo
			-   Leaves may become yellow and drop prematurely
			-   Fruit may have raised, scab-like lesions


4.  Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum):
		Causes:
			-   Caused by the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum
			-   Enters the plant through the roots and colonizes the xylem tissue, causing wilting and yellowing of the leaves
			-   Spreads through infected soil, contaminated tools and equipment, and infected plant debris
			-   Can survive in the soil for several years
		Symptomps:
			-   Wilting and yellowing of the leaves, typically starting on one side of the plant
			-   Dark discoloration of the vascular tissue in the stem
			-   Plants may die suddenly or gradually over a period of weeks
			-   Brown, water-soaked lesions may appear on the fruit


5.  Southern bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2):
		Causes:
			-   A strain of the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum that affects tomato plants in warmer regions
			-   Enters the plant through the roots and colonizes the xylem tissue, causing wilting and yellowing of the leaves
			-   Spreads through infected soil, contaminated tools and equipment, and infected plant debris
			-   Can survive in the soil for several years
		Symptomps:
			-   Similar symptoms to bacterial wilt, but affects tomato plants in warmer regions


6.  Pith necrosis (Pseudomonas corrugata):
		Causes:
			-   Caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas corrugata
			-   Enters the plant through wounds and colonizes the pith tissue, causing necrosis and stem rot
			-   Spreads through contaminated tools and equipment, and infected plant debris
		Symptomps:
			-   Discoloration and rotting of the stem, particularly near the soil line
			-   Wilting of the leaves and plant collapse
			-   Plant may develop a foul odor


7.  Tomato bacterial fruit rot (Ralstonia solanacearum):
		Causes:
			-   Caused by the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum
			-   Enters the plant through the roots and colonizes the xylem tissue, causing wilting and yellowing of the leaves
			-   Spreads to the fruit through the vascular system, causing rot and discoloration of the fruit.
			-   Can survive in the soil for several years.
		Symptomps:
			-   Wilting and yellowing of the leaves
			-   Brown, water-soaked lesions on the fruit
			-   Lesions may enlarge and become black and sunken
			-   Fruit may rot and become soft
