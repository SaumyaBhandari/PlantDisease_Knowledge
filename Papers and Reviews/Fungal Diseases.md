5.  Anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.):
		Causes:
			-   Fungus survives in soil and plant debris
			-   Spreads through wind, rain, and infected seed
			-   Warm, wet weather and overhead irrigation promote the disease
		Symptomps:
			-   Circular, sunken lesions on fruit with a water-soaked appearance
			-   Lesions may become larger and sunken as the fruit ripens
			-   Brown, circular lesions on leaves
			-   Leaf drop and defoliation


6.  Powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica):
		Causes:
			-   Fungus spreads through windborne spores
			-   Warm, dry weather with high humidity at night promotes the disease
			-   Crowded plants and poor air circulation also promote the disease
		Symptomps:
			-   White, powdery growth on the upper surfaces of leaves
			-   Leaves may become distorted or stunted
			-   Reduced yield
			-   Infected fruit may be deformed or have a corky appearance


7.  Gray mold (Botrytis cinerea):
		Causes:
			-   Fungus survives in soil, plant debris, and infected fruit
			-   Spreads through windborne spores and infected seed
			-   Cool, humid weather and dense plant growth promote the disease
		Symptomps
			-   Brown, water-soaked lesions on leaves and fruit
			-   Fuzzy, gray mold growth on lesions in humid conditions
			-   Soft, rotting fruit
			-   Leaf drop and defoliation
