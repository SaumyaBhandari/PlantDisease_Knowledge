1.  Early blight (Alternaria solani):
		Causes:
			-   Fungus survives in soil and plant debris
			-   Spreads through splashing water, wind, and infected seed
			-   Warm, humid weather and crowded plants promote the disease
		Symptomps:
			-   Dark, concentric rings on leaves, starting from the bottom of the plant
			-   Brown spots with a target-like appearance
			-   Leaf drop and defoliation
			-   Sunken, leathery lesions on fruit


2.  Late blight (Phytophthora infestans):
		Causes
			-   Fungus survives in soil, plant debris, and infected potato tubers
			-   Spreads through windborne spores and infected seed
			-   Cool, wet weather and high humidity promote the disease
		Symptomps
			-   Irregularly-shaped, water-soaked lesions on leaves
			-   White, fluffy growth on the underside of leaves in humid conditions
			-   Leaf drop and defoliation
			-   Brown, firm lesions on fruit


3.  Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum):
		Causes:  
			- Fungus survives in soil and plant debris
			-   Spreads through infected seed and water
			-   Warm, dry weather and poorly-drained soil promote the disease
		Symptomps:
			-   Yellowing and wilting of the lower leaves
			-   Browning and discoloration of the vascular tissue in the stem
			-   Stunting and poor growth
			-   Plants may die suddenly or gradually


4.  Verticillium wilt (Verticillium spp.):
		Causes:  
			- Fungus survives in soil and plant debris
			-   Spreads through water, wind, and infected seed
			-   Cool, damp weather and compacted soil promote the disease
		Symptomps:
			-   Wilting and yellowing of the leaves, starting from the bottom of the plant
			-   Brown discoloration of the vascular tissue in the stem
			-   Stunting and poor growth
			-   Plants may die suddenly or gradually


5.  Anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.):
		Causes:
			-   Fungus survives in soil and plant debris
			-   Spreads through wind, rain, and infected seed
			-   Warm, wet weather and overhead irrigation promote the disease
		Symptomps:
			-   Circular, sunken lesions on fruit with a water-soaked appearance
			-   Lesions may become larger and sunken as the fruit ripens
			-   Brown, circular lesions on leaves
			-   Leaf drop and defoliation


6.  Powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica):
		Causes:
			-   Fungus spreads through windborne spores
			-   Warm, dry weather with high humidity at night promotes the disease
			-   Crowded plants and poor air circulation also promote the disease
		Symptomps:
			-   White, powdery growth on the upper surfaces of leaves
			-   Leaves may become distorted or stunted
			-   Reduced yield
			-   Infected fruit may be deformed or have a corky appearance


7.  Gray mold (Botrytis cinerea):
		Causes:
			-   Fungus survives in soil, plant debris, and infected fruit
			-   Spreads through windborne spores and infected seed
			-   Cool, humid weather and dense plant growth promote the disease
		Symptomps
			-   Brown, water-soaked lesions on leaves and fruit
			-   Fuzzy, gray mold growth on lesions in humid conditions
			-   Soft, rotting fruit
			-   Leaf drop and defoliation
