Causes:

-   TCDVd is caused by a viroid, which is a small, single-stranded RNA molecule that can infect plants.
-   The viroid is transmitted through infected seed or by mechanical transmission during cultivation activities.
-   TCDVd is most commonly found in warm, tropical regions.

Symptoms:

-   Chlorotic (yellowing) [[Leaf|leaves]].
-   Stunted growth and reduced yield.
-   Necrotic (dead) spots on [[leaf|leaves]] and [[leaf|stems]].
-   Malformed [[Fruit|fruit]].
